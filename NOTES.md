# Project Notes

## What's the Plan?
My plan with project was to simulate the process of data collection, data cleaning, data manipulation, data analysis, and data visualization. 
I wasn"t too clear on how to go about this so I thought: 'How could I accomplish what was aforementioned while also placing personal investment into this project to benefit myself and also make sure I was more likely to see the project through to completion?' 

So I settled upon this idea at the start of this year to embark on a fitness journey and track my progress to later analyze it once  I accrued enough data.

## First Hurdle
What in the world can I track thats capable of being analyzed and how in the world  will I go about doing this?
I realized I have a smart watch at my disposal and could utilize it to aid my cause. I focused on data that I wouldnt have to constantly remember to track outside of weight and mood, so I decided on steps, sleep, and calories. though it definetly not the most in-depth measurements, it's a decent place to start.

## Data Collection
- Data collection wasn't too challenging of a process, I made sure that every night before sleep i would input the data from that day. The most difficult aspect was remembering to weigh myself at the start of each day, besides that everyting was very straight forward.

- I also had difficulty deciding what was enough data, I thought a month was far too small and a year was too much. I settled on having around 150 instances of data would be acceptable and just the right amount to analize potential trends/patterns. After 5 months I decided to embark on the next stage of the project.
