# 🗒️ Project Notes

## 💡 What's the Plan?
My plan for this project was to simulate the full process of data collection, cleaning, manipulation, analysis, and visualization.  
I wasn’t entirely sure how to go about it at first, so I asked myself: *How can I accomplish this while also building something I’m personally invested in—something that benefits me and keeps me motivated to follow through?*

That led me to an idea I had at the start of the year: to embark on a fitness journey and track my progress, with the intention of analyzing the data once I had enough of it.

## 🚧 First Hurdle
My first big question was: *What kind of data should I track that’s meaningful and also possible to analyze?*

I realized I had a smartwatch I could use to passively track metrics. To keep things manageable, I focused on data that didn’t require too much manual entry—just weight and mood. The rest (steps, sleep, and calories) would be automatically tracked. It’s definitely not the most in-depth dataset, but it was a great starting point.

## 📊 Data Collection
- Collecting the data was pretty straightforward. Every night before bed, I would log that day’s information.
- The hardest part was remembering to weigh myself each morning—definitely missed a few entries there.
- Another challenge was deciding *how much* data I needed. A single month felt too short and a year too long. I landed on 150+ entries as a good balance. After five months of logging, I moved on to the next phase: analysis.

## 🔍 Taking a Look
At first, each month had its own sheet, which looked clean but made analysis tricky. So I created a **master sheet** with all data from January to May to enable easier use of pivot tables.

One issue I ran into: I couldn’t group data by month in the pivot table. I realized this was because I didn’t have a dedicated column identifying the month of each entry. After adding that column, grouping worked perfectly, and I could finally start building out the visuals and insights.

## 🤔 Final Thoughts & Reflections
- Creating a project notes section wasn’t part of the original plan, but I’m glad I added it. While a bit scatterbrained (since I’m writing this post-project), it helped me process my learning. I’ll definitely document more *during* the process next time.
- The data provided some cool insights, but more would’ve been ideal. Next time, I’d like to include metrics like resting heart rate, stress levels, calorie intake, and body fat percentage (even monthly).
- One thing that bugged me was the lack of a distinct *active calories* column. That would’ve been super helpful for accurately assessing calories burned during specific exercises. The chart I made on average calories burned isn’t as accurate as I’d hoped.
- All in all, this 5-month process was really rewarding. It wasn’t always easy to stay organized, but things became clearer over time. I definitely grew my technical skills and I’m really excited to keep the momentum going into the next project.

**Thanks for reading—see you in the next one! 🚀**
