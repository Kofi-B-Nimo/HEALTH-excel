# Project Notes

## What's the Plan?
My plan with project was to simulate the process of data collection, data cleaning, data manipulation, data analysis, and data visualization. 
I wasn"t too clear on how to go about this so I thought: 'How could I accomplish what was aforementioned while also placing personal investment into this project to benefit myself and also make sure I was more likely to see the project through to completion?' 

So I settled upon this idea at the start of this year to embark on a fitness journey and track my progress to later analyze it once  I accrued enough data.

## First Hurdle
What in the world can I track thats capable of being analyzed and how in the world  will I go about doing this?
I realized I have a smart watch at my disposal and could utilize it to aid my cause. I focused on data that I wouldnt have to constantly remember to track outside of weight and mood, so I decided on steps, sleep, and calories. though it definetly not the most in-depth measurements, it's a decent place to start.

## Data Collection
- Data collection wasn't too challenging of a process, I made sure that every night before sleep i would input the data from that day. The most difficult aspect was remembering to weigh myself at the start of each day, besides that everyting was very straight forward.

- I also had difficulty deciding what was enough data, I thought a month was far too small and a year was too much. I settled on having around 150 instances of data would be acceptable and just the right amount to analize potential trends/patterns. After 5 months I decided to embark on the next stage of the project.

## Taking a Look
The data was organized by each month having its own sheet, which is preferable when looking at it but not ideal for analysis. My first job was to consolidate the data into one sheet, so i created a new sheet with data from January to May in order to then be able to create pivot tables from the consolidated chart.

one problem I did encounter while creating the pivot tables, to answer the various questions was; not being able to group the pieces of data into months, because i lacked a column that clearly stated what month each piece of data fell under, I had to incorporate that column into the consolidated sheet, and loe and behold, my pivot tables started working!

## Thoughts (more thoughts)
- Though the data previded insights on certain health trends and was  definitely insightful, ideally more insight would've been better. Data such as; resting heart rate, stress levels, calorie intake, body fat percentage ( taken on a monthly basis)
- Something that also really bothered me was the fact that there wasnt a distinct active calorie column that would be able to specifically tell me how many calories weere burned doing a particular exercise. I realized this while creating the " AVG. CALORIES BURNED " chart, so that information isn't as accurate as i would like it to be.
- overall, the process over the past 5 months was fruitful and rewarding, it was a bit challenging organizing myself during the process but as it went on it got clearer and clearer. definitely grew technically and I'm very excited to keep the train going and journey onto to the next project, see you there!
