# Project Notes

## What's the Plan?
My plan with project was to simulate the process of data collection, data cleaning, data manipulation, data analysis, and data visualization. 
I wasn"t too clear on how to go about this so I thought: 'How could I accomplish what was aforementioned while also placing personal investment into this project to benefit myself and also make sure I was more likely to see the project through to completion?' 

So I settled upon this idea at the start of this year to embark on a fitness journey and track my progress to later analyze it once  I accrued enough data.

## First Hurdle
What in the world can I track thats capable of being analyzed and how in the world  will i go about doing this?
