# Project Overview
This Excel file is a comprehensive tool designed to track daily health and fitness metrics for personal growth and goal setting. This process involved data collection, data analysis, and data visualization

## Dataset used
<a href = "https://github.com/Kofi-B-Nimo/HEALTH-excel/blob/main/HEALTH%20TRACKER.xlsx"> Health Progress Tracker</a>


## Key Analytical Questions Explored
- What is the ratio of active days to rest days?
  
- Is there an upward trend in active days over the course of several months?
  
- How does mood differ on active days versus rest days?
  
- Is there a positive correlation between steps taken and weight fluctuations?
  
- What is the relationship between sleep duration and reported mood?
  
- Which mode of exercise burns the most calories on average?

## Process
- 5 months of daily data collection
  
- made sure data is clean with respect to data types and data format
  
- created pivot tables according to the questions asked
  
- merged all pivot tables into one dashboard for data visualization

## Project Insights
- From the start of January to the end of April, 73% of days were active and 27% were rest days, indicating a strong level of consistency in physical activity.
- Overall, the number of active days remained relatively consistent from January through April, with no clear upward trend month to month. However, there was a noticeable spike in activity during April.
- While there’s no definitive conclusion, the data suggests that active days tend to be associated with a slightly higher average mood compared to rest days.
- The data indicates a direct correlation between weight and physical activity levels—months with higher average step counts generally align with lower average weight, suggesting a potential relationship between increased activity and weight management.
- The data shows no clear correlation between hours of sleep and recorded mood, suggesting that sleep duration alone may not be a strong predictor of daily mood in this case.
- Among recorded activities, long-distance runs consistently burned the most calories on average, with basketball following closely behind as another high-calorie-burning exercise.
  

## Final Conclusion
Overall, the data shows that I stayed pretty consistent with my activity levels from January to April, with a big spike in April. Active days tended to line up with better moods, and there seems to be a clear link between staying active and keeping my weight down. On the other hand, sleep didn’t seem to have much impact on mood based on this data.

In the future, tracking things like heart rate, stress levels, or even meal quality could help paint a clearer picture. It might also help to look at sleep quality, not just hours slept.
